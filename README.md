ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

ðŸŽ“ I recently completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Canterbury.

ðŸ’¼ I am currently seeking a job to start my career as a software developer.

âš¡ My technical expertise includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, Sanity, and Vercel.

ðŸŒ± I have been working on a small commercial project - Safari101 that displays travel services in Africa and allows requests. On the back-end, I have enabled the service provider to manage all the services in Sanity studio. All the features are complete, now waiting for the domain being made and travel services being populated by the client.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm planning my own social media project and studying C#.Net, Azure to use them for my project and also expand my job opportunity area.
